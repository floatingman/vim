" " Notes...
" "
" " :map     j gg (j will be mapped to gg)
" " :map     Q j  (Q will also be mapped to gg, because j will be expanded ->

" " :noremap W j  (W will be mapped to j not to gg, because j will not be
" expanded -> non recursive)
" "
" " These mappings work in all modes. To have mappings work in only specific
" " modes then denote the mapping with the mode character.
" "
" " e.g.
" " to map something in just NORMAL mode use :nmap or :nnoremap
" " to map something in just VISUAL mode use :vmap or :vnoremap

" Command to use sudo when needed

" Same with mapping <C-W>|
